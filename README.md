# Mluvka: Modern Geometric Typeface
![screen](/readme/mainbanner.jpg)
Mluvka is a modern geometric sans-serif tyeface, which is designed primarily for display size. Its design is based on the [+Jakarta Sans](https://tokotype.github.io/plusjakarta-sans/) font by Tokotype. After a long time, the second version is here!

## üë®‚Äçüíª Design 
Mluvka has the same x-height as Jakarta Sans, so that hasn't changed. As a result, it provides high readability even at smaller sizes after the tracking change. 

This makes it possible to combine the typeface with other...

like [Libre Baskerville](https://github.com/impallari/Libre-Baskerville) by Impallari. Proxima Sera (Mark Simonson) or Publico Text (Commercial Type) may also be a good choice for pairing.
